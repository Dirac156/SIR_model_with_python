# Modeling Epidemics (SIR)

## Description

This project is a group project where we are going to build a SIR model with python.
How software has to aspect:
* We can model epidemic using existent data : Take some data online and model it to show to increase or decrease of the number of people infected, susceptible and people who have recovered over a certain period of time.

* We can model epidemic using the initial data : When we know the initial number of people who have recovered, infected and susceptible. We will also need to variables (alpha and beta) that we are going to use to see the change as the time passed.

## Technology

Python is our Technology we used because it has some wonderfull libraries that will allow us to :

* Graph : Matplotlib
* Increase time : Numpy
* Find the definite integral: scypy
